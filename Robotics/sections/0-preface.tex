This is an unofficial summary for the lecture \textit{Robotics} (IN2067) at the Technical University of Munich (winter semester 2021/2022).\\
We aim to cover all the content from the exercises and supplement it with explanations from the book \textit{Introduction to Robotics - Mechanics and Control (3rd ed.)} by John J. Craig. A lot of the content is based on the Stanford lecture \textit{Introduction to Robotics} by professor Oussama Khatib, which you can watch on \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65CC0384A1798ADF}{YouTube}. Many of the figures in this summary are direct screenshots of his slides. Note, that the notations are not consistent throughout this summary.\\

Stanford lectures not covered:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture 9: Robots and Vision
	\item Lecture 10: Trajectory Generation
\end{itemize}
