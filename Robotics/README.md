# Robotics Lecture Summary (IN2067)

This is an unofficial summary for the lecture *Robotics* (IN2067) at the Technical University of Munich (winter semester 2021/2022).

We aim to cover all the content from the exercises and supplement it with explanations from the book *Introduction to Robotics - Mechanics and Control (3rd ed.)* by John J. Craig. A lot of the content is based on the Stanford lecture *Introduction to Robotics* by prof. Oussama Khatib, which you can watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65CC0384A1798ADF). Many of the figures in this summary are direct screenshots of his slides. Note, that the notations are not consistent throughout this summary.
