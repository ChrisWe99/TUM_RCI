# TUM RCI Lecture Notes 📝

In this repository you can find lecture notes and cheat sheets for some of the courses in *Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence*. 

I started my Master in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich in the winter semester of 2021/2022. At the time, I could not find as many good lecture notes for my courses online as was the case in my Bachelor. I created this repo hoping that over time it will become the ressource I was looking for. Maybe it will be of help to you!
